#!/bin/bash
awk -F: '{print $1, $6}' /etc/passwd | sort
Explanation:
awk -F:: This sets the field separator to : (which separates fields in /etc/passwd).
{print $1, $6}: This prints the first field (username) and the sixth field (home directory).
sort: This sorts the output alphabetically by username.
Step 3: Save and Exit
If youâ€™re using nano, save the file by pressing CTRL + O, then press ENTER, and exit by pressing CTRL + X.

Step 4: Make the Script Executable
Make the script executable by running:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x list_users.sh
Step 5: Run the Script
You can now run the script with the following command:

bash
Copy code
./list_users.sh
Example Output
